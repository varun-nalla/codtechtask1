Overview of the Project
Project:Temperature and humidity monitoring with DHT sensor

Objective:
1) Understand how to interface sensors with microcontrollers.
2) Learn to measure and process environmental parameters like temperature and humidity.
3) Display sensor readings on an LCD or serial monitor.
4) Simulate the project to avoid dependency on physical hardware.

Key Activities

1)Setup and Configuration:
Simulate the connection of the Arduino, DHT-11 sensor, LCD, potentiometer, and other components on a virtual platform.
Configure the software to simulate the environment.

2)Sensor Integration:
Write code to read temperature and humidity data from the DHT-11 sensor using the DHT library.

3)Display Output:
Interface a 16x2 LCD screen with the Arduino to display sensor readings.
Alternatively, use the serial monitor to view the data in real-time.

4)Testing and Debugging:
Simulate different temperature and humidity inputs to validate the system's functionality.

Technologies Used:
1)Arduino IDE: For writing, compiling, and uploading code to the Arduino.
2)DHT Library: For interfacing with the DHT-11 sensor.
3)Tinkercad/Proteus: For simulating the circuit and code.
4)Embedded C: Programming language used to write the Arduino sketch

Key Insights:

1)Sensor Interfacing:
Learned the process of interfacing DHT-11 with Arduino and extracting sensor data.

2)Data Processing:
Understood how the DHT library simplifies the process of obtaining temperature and humidity values.

3)Display Systems:
Gained experience in interfacing and configuring an LCD to display real-time data.

4)Software Simulation:
Explored the advantages of software-based simulation tools for testing embedded systems without physical hardware.
